# ARIA ELITE Production Security Checklist

## ðŸ”’ Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Change all default passwords in `.env` file
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 16 characters)
- [ ] Generate secure JWT secrets and encryption keys
- [ ] Store API keys securely (consider using a secrets management service)
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control

### Database Security
- [ ] Use strong PostgreSQL password
- [ ] Enable SSL connections to database
- [ ] Restrict database access to application containers only
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption
- [ ] Monitor database access logs

### Network Security
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (only allow necessary ports)
- [ ] Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for additional security layer
- [ ] Disable unnecessary services and ports

### Application Security
- [ ] Run containers as non-root users
- [ ] Keep all dependencies updated
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Use secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Enable CORS properly for production domains
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Container Security
- [ ] Use minimal base images
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement resource limits
- [ ] Use read-only filesystems where possible
- [ ] Regular security updates

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities
- [ ] Set up alerts for security events
- [ ] Regular log rotation and archival
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Regular automated backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures
- [ ] Encrypt backup data
- [ ] Store backups in secure, off-site location
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

## ðŸš¨ Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents
